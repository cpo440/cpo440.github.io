                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I’m Rick Hoskins, an IT Support Specialist with a heart for service and a calling to help others
                        — both through
                        technology and in everyday life. With CompTIA A+ certification and hands-on experience solving
                        real-world tech issues, I
                        specialize in diagnosing problems, offering clear solutions, and supporting users with patience
                        and professionalism.
                        Whether it’s a home setup or a business environment, I enjoy restoring order and confidence when
                        technology fails.</p>

                    <p>Before entering the IT field, I served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 1992 as an infantry soldier,
                        earning several honors
                        including the Army Achievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster. I later continued my service as a
                        police officer, where I
                        developed strong communication skills, crisis management ability, and a commitment to doing
                        what’s right — even under
                        pressure. These experiences shaped the way I approach every job: with discipline, integrity, and
                        a steady focus on
                        helping people.</p>

                    <p>My educational background includes a high school diploma from Hamilton High School in Hamilton,
                        Ohio, as well as studies
                        in software engineering at Herzing University. This academic experience deepened my
                        understanding of computer systems
                        and software, while my CompTIA A+ certification provided practical, hands-on knowledge in
                        troubleshooting, security, and
                        support fundamentals. I continually seek to grow both professionally and personally to better
                        serve those who rely on my
                        skills.</p>

                    <p>My faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of who I am and how I serve. I believe every
                        interaction is an opportunity to
                        show kindness, build trust, and reflect God’s love through my work. Whether I’m fixing a
                        technical issue or guiding
                        someone through a frustrating moment, I want people to walk away not just with a solution, but
                        with the sense that
                        they’ve been genuinely cared for. My goal is to serve with excellence, humility, and a heart
                        that honors God in all I do.</p>
