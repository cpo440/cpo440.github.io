                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I‚Äôm Rick Hoskins, an IT Support Specialist with a heart for service and a calling to help
                        others
                        ‚Äî both through
                        technology and in everyday life. With CompTIA A+ certification and hands-on experience
                        solving
                        real-world tech issues, I
                        specialize in diagnosing problems, offering clear solutions, and supporting users with
                        patience
                        and professionalism.
                        Whether it‚Äôs a home setup or a business environment, I enjoy restoring order and confidence
                        when
                        technology fails.</p>

                    <p>Before entering the IT field, I served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 1992 as an infantry
                        soldier,
                        earning several honors
                        including the Army Achievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster. I later continued my service as
                        a
                        police officer, where I
                        developed strong communication skills, crisis management ability, and a commitment to doing
                        what‚Äôs right ‚Äî even under
                        pressure. These experiences shaped the way I approach every job: with discipline, integrity,
                        and
                        a steady focus on
                        helping people.</p>

                    <p>My educational background includes a high school diploma from Hamilton High School in
                        Hamilton,
                        Ohio, as well as studies
                        in software engineering at Herzing University. This academic experience deepened my
                        understanding of computer systems
                        and software, while my CompTIA A+ certification provided practical, hands-on knowledge in
                        troubleshooting, security, and
                        support fundamentals. I continually seek to grow both professionally and personally to
                        better
                        serve those who rely on my
                        skills.</p>

                    <p>My faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of who I am and how I serve. I believe every
                        interaction is an opportunity to
                        show kindness, build trust, and reflect God‚Äôs love through my work. Whether I‚Äôm fixing a
                        technical issue or guiding
                        someone through a frustrating moment, I want people to walk away not just with a solution,
                        but
                        with the sense that
                        they‚Äôve been genuinely cared for. My goal is to serve with excellence, humility, and a heart
                        that honors God in all I do.</p>
